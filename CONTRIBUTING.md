### Contributing :

All contributions that help making this project better are welcome be it a simple spelling correction
in the documentation or adding a complete new feature. Contributors are expected to create issues
and discuss the changes well before opening the pull requests.Join our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/batchOf18/contest?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge) to find out more opportunities to contribute.

##### Making Pull Request :

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github (if you haven't made any). 
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! For each small independent feature to be added, we expect separate branch. Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- Test your code well before pushing.
- Add or change the documentation as needed (in case you use some new methods, add resources for the same [here](https://github.com/harshraj22/contest/tree/master/resources/resources.md))
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.

- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
