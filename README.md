#### Goals :
   some of the features it should have include:
   
   * It should have mechanism to submit solution.
   * User should be able to run the code and execution results including compiling, correctness and running time should be displayed to user.
   * It should store all solutions submitted by user.
   * User should be able to browse submitted solutions.
# Plan
### Phase 0 :
    Getting familiar with Git and Brainstorming about the project.

### Phase 1 :
    Build a basic structure where students logs in, Submits solution, and gets evaluated 
    (use linux commmands for evaluation and use strict evaluation (set time limit)).

### Phase 2 :
    Add better authentication (ask them to create account on website and verify using email verification, 
    can use something like OpenId or something similarly secure). Add feature to view old submitted 
    code by the user to himself/herself. Feature to see current status of all submissions made on
    the problem statement and display other details related to specific questions 
    e.g num of successful submissions.
    
### Phase 3 :
    Add feature to create teams and make the contest support team participation as well. 
    Add feature to create contest dynamically (the admin decides number of question to set and 
    the contest page has features to show that many question and evaluation).
