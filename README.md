#### Small Description :
   * Make a contest hosting website with minimal features that are present in each such websites.

## Phase 0 :
    Getting familiar with Git and Brainstorming about the project.

## Phase 1 :
    Build a basic structure where students logs in, Submits solution, and gets evaluated 
    (use linux commmands for evaluation and use strict evaluation (set time limit)).

## Phase 2 :
    Add better authentication (ask them to create account on website and verify using email verification, 
    can use something like OpenId or something similarly secure). Add feature to view old submitted 
    code by the user to himself/herself. Feature to see current status of all submissions made on
    the problem statement and display other details related to specific questions 
    e.g num of successful submissions.
    
## Phase 3 :
    Add feature to create teams and make the contest support team participation as well. 
    Add feature to create contest dynamically (the admin decides number of question to set and 
    the contest page has features to show that many question and evaluation).
    
Note that contribution to this project is not all about writing PHP codes or mysql queries. 
People working for frontend, testing the website to find bugs or other errors, and helping others
by documenting it are equally important and are welcome. Also contributing here is not only about adding features and making pull request. Contributors, can help maintainers by reviewing pull requests and commenting in case the feel anything more is required in case of any pull request.
